					<li>
						Place potatoes in a saucepan. Cover with water. Bring to boil. Cook for 15-20 minutes or until tender when pierced with a small knife. Drain. Set aside to cool completely.
					</li>
					<li>
						Meanwhile, make the raita. Place cumin in a small frying pan over medium heat. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until aromatic and toasted. Transfer to a small food processor. Add mint , coriander , ginger , garlic and green chilli . Process until finely chopped. Add yoghurt and process until combined. Season with salt. Place in the fridge until ready to serve.
					</li>
					<li>
						Peel off and discard potato skins. Transfer potato to a large bowl. Use a fork or potato masher to roughly mash. Add breadcrumbs , cornflour , coriander , green chilli , garam masala , ginger and chilli powder or cayenne . Season with salt. Mix until combined.
					</li>
					<li>
						Roll heaped tablespoonfuls of potato mixture into balls. Press each ball into flat patties about 5cm in diameter.
					</li>
					<li>
						Add oil to a large non-stick frying pan to come 1.5cm up side of pan. Heat over medium-high heat. Cook the potato cakes, in 2 batches if necessary, for 2-3 minutes each side or until golden. (Don’t turn too soon or they will stick.) Drain on a plate lined with paper towel. Serve warm with raita and extra mint leaves.
